my first intership project at brainwave matrix solution.
ATM Management System (C++ Project)
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is a simple ATM Management System written in C++ that allows users to:
âœ” Withdraw money
âœ” Deposit money
âœ” Check account balance
âœ” Exit safely

It simulates an ATM interface with options to interact with Current and Savings accounts, requiring a PIN for security.
